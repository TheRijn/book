# Programming Basics

(in Dutch: Basisboek Programmeren)

This is a practice book on programming concepts for use alongside a first programming course. The pseudo-language in this version of the book is a little bit C-like, but many parts can be used in a Python-based course as well. We intend to add more chapters that detail concepts like for-each loops.
