\paragraph{Mutating}

Arrays are \emph{mutable}, which means that once we have created an array, we can still make changes later. Usually, that does not mean that the \emph{length} of the array can be changed, but each of its elements can. Take this example:

\begin{nnflisting}
lan = [0, 0, 0]
lan[1] = 5
\end{nnflisting}

First we create an array containing three 0's, after which we change the second element of the array to \texttt{5}. So after executing this code fragment, we have an array containing \texttt{[0, 5, 0]}.
