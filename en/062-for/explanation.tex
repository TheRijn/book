\paragraph{Tracing}

In the following code fragment we use a \texttt{for}-loop to manipulate a variable called \texttt{a}.

\begin{nnflisting}
a = -10
for(i = 0; i < 2; i++)
    a = i * 2
a = a + 6
\end{nnflisting}

As soon as we try to trace the loop using previous techniques, we realize that line 2 contains many parts that are used at other points in the code. One way to more easily perform the trace is to first translate the code into a \texttt{while}-loop, which is fine. We can also augment our tracing technique to better accommodate \texttt{for}-loops. Let's make the initialization (\texttt{i = 0}), condition (\texttt{i < 2}) and update (\texttt{i++}) explicit in the trace:

\setlength\tabcolsep{3pt}
\begin{tracelist-left}[l|ccccccccccccc]
regel & \texttt{1} & \texttt{2} & \texttt{2} & \texttt{3} & \texttt{2} & \texttt{2} & \texttt{3} & \texttt{2} & \texttt{2} & \texttt{4} \\
&  & \texttt{(i = 0)} & \texttt{(i < 2)} & & \texttt{(i++)} & \texttt{(i < 2)} &  & \texttt{(i++)} & \texttt{(i < 2)} &  \\
\hline
var \texttt{i} & & \fbox{\texttt{0}} & \texttt{0} & \texttt{0} & \fbox{\texttt{1}} & \texttt{1} & \texttt{1} & \fbox{\texttt{2}} & \texttt{2} & \\
var \texttt{a} & \fbox{\texttt{-10}} & \texttt{-10} & \texttt{-10} & \fbox{\texttt{0}} & \texttt{0} & \texttt{0} & \fbox{\texttt{2}} & \texttt{2} & \texttt{2} & \fbox{\texttt{8}} \\
\texttt{i < 2} & & & \texttt{true} & & & \texttt{true} & & & \fbox{\texttt{false}} & \\
\end{tracelist-left}
\setlength{\tabcolsep}{6pt}

Once you are used to the form of the \texttt{for}-loop, you might reduce the trace again:

\begin{tracelist-left}[l|ccccccccccccc]
regel & \texttt{1} & \texttt{2} & \texttt{2} & \texttt{3} & \texttt{2} & \texttt{2} & \texttt{3} & \texttt{2} & \texttt{2} & \texttt{4} \\ \hline
var \texttt{i} & & \fbox{\texttt{0}} & \texttt{0} & \texttt{0} & \fbox{\texttt{1}} & \texttt{1} & \texttt{1} & \fbox{\texttt{2}} & \texttt{2} & \\
var \texttt{a} & \fbox{\texttt{-10}} & \texttt{-10} & \texttt{-10} & \fbox{\texttt{0}} & \texttt{0} & \texttt{0} & \fbox{\texttt{2}} & \texttt{2} & \texttt{2} & \fbox{\texttt{8}} \\
\texttt{i < 2} & & & \texttt{true} & & & \texttt{true} & & & \fbox{\texttt{false}} & \\
\end{tracelist-left}
