\paragraph{Loops}

Arrays, like strings, are often used with loops to extract information, to change whole arrays or to summarize them.

\begin{nnflisting}
eus = [0, 0, 0, 0]
for(i = 0; i < length(eus); i++)
    eus[i] = i * 2
\end{nnflisting}

After running this code fragment the array \texttt{eus} contains values \texttt{0}, \texttt{2}, \texttt{4} and \texttt{6}. We use the \texttt{length} command to calculate the array's size. Note that not all languages allow you to simply retrieve the length of an array; in those case you will need to keep track of that separately, for example using an integer in a variable.
