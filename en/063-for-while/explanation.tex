\paragraph{Rewriting} This is the side-by-side comparison of \texttt{for}- and \texttt{while}-loops you saw earlier:

\begin{tabular}{lp{4em}l}
                                         && \verb|<init>| \\
\verb|for(<init>|\verb|; <condition>|\verb|; <update>|\verb|)|
&& \verb|while|\verb|(<condition>)| \\
\verb|    <loop body>|             && \verb|    <loop body>| \\
                                         && \verb|    |\verb|<update>|
\end{tabular}

You can use it to translate \texttt{for}-loops to \texttt{while}-loops and the other way around. After doing it, you can check your work by tracing both versions and comparing the results.
